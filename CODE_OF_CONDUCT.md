# Code of Conduct

We’re committed to a friendly, safe, and welcoming community.

- Be respectful and assume good intent.
- No harassment, hate speech, or discrimination.
- Keep feedback constructive; review code, not people.
- If there’s a problem, open an issue. Maintainers will address it as time allows.

Enforcement is at the maintainers’ discretion; repeated or severe violations may lead to moderation actions.
